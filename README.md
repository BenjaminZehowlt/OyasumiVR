### Built With

Oyasumi has been built with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.app/).

## Supported Devices

### Battery Automations
Currently Oyasumi supports battery automations for all SteamVR devices that:
1. Support reporting for battery levels and charging status
2. Support being turned off via SteamVR. 

This includes, but is not limited to the following devices:
- HTC Vive Controllers/Wands
- Index Controllers/Knuckles
- Vive Trackers (1.0/2.0/3.0)
- Tundra Trackers\*

This means that any Oculus controller is unlikely to work, and SlimeVR trackers are unsupported unless they implement this functionality in their [OpenVR driver](https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-OpenVR-Driver).

*(\*) Tundra trackers have very delayed reporting of battery levels and charging status. This means that while automations will still work, they will be very delayed (minutes in the double digits), unless Tundra fixes this in their tracker firmware. (https://forum.tundra-labs.com/t/firmware-issues/746)*

### GPU Automations

Currently, only NVIDIA cards are supported for setting power limits. AMD and Intel cards are not yet supported.

## Development

To start development on Oyasumi, start by following Tauri's [prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) (Installing Rust).
Make sure to grab the nightly, as Oyasumi uses some functionality that is not yet available in the current stable release of Rust.

After you have followed the guide and installed Rust, install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

It could be helpful to install the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) globally.

Once you have set up these dependencies, you can continue as follows:

1. Check out Oyasumi on your machine.
2. Run `npm run install` or `yarn`, depending on whether you prefer using `npm` or `yarn`.
3. Run `npm run build` or `yarn build` at least once.

From here, you can run `npm run tauri dev` or `yarn tauri dev` to run the application locally.

## License

Oyasumi is available under the [MIT](https://github.com/Raphiiko/Oyasumi/blob/develop/LICENSE.md) license.
